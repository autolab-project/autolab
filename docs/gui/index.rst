Graphical User Interface (GUI)
==============================

Autolab is provided with a user-friendly graphical interface based on the **Device** interface, that allows the user to interact even more easily with its instruments. It can be used only for local configurations (see :ref:`localconfig`).

The GUI has four panels : a **Control Panel** that allows to see visually the architecture of a **Device**, and to interact with an instrument through the *Variables* and *Actions*. The **Monitoring Panel** allows the user to monitor a *Variable* in time. The **Scanning Panel** allows the user to configure the scan of a parameter and the execution of a custom recipe for each value of the parameter. The **Plotting Panel** allows the user to plot data.
